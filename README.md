# Screwdriver Type Identification Project

 Add short description of project here > This project uses AI and Machine Learning to identify what type of screwdriver is in an image from the main 4 types (Phillips, Flathead, Hex, and Torx). It does this using ImageNet to differentiate between each type and label each one differently.

## The Algorithm

The Classification Algorithm works by using ImageNet and a labels.txt file to classify what object is in the image, whether it's a live feed from a camera or a still image. The way it works is that ImageNet basically analyzes and connects similarities between images and puts them all under an umbrella, which is the label.

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 


## Running this project

1. Add steps for running this project. Prerequisites: a Jetson Nano Developer Kit from NVIDIA is suggested, but alternatives exist. Images of screwdrivers for testing are required as well. Step 1: Upload an image to the board by copying it from your computer to the board via terminal or using Visual Studio Code, or have a live camera feed open. Step 2: Run the project with the target image being the image you uploaded. Step 3: View the results by opening the image, the results will be displayed as a label of the class, the percentage of accuracy. 
2. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.
